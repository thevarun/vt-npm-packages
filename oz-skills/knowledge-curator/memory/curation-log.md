## 2026-03-01 (Bootstrap Run)

**Sources**: +7 / -1 = 33/40
**Research queries**:
- NLM: "solo developer AI-assisted testing strategies automated QA CI/CD developer productivity" (fast mode) — yielded 10 results, imported 3
- Web: "solo SaaS developer AI design workflow 2026" — found solopreneur/productivity candidates
- Web: "AI automated testing solo developer workflow 2026" — found testing-qa candidates
- Web: "developer-led growth marketing strategies SaaS solopreneur 2026" — found marketing-growth candidates
**Research quality**: NLM research was moderately useful — 3/10 results worth importing. Web search was more productive for targeted gap-filling. Medium URLs failed to import (platform blocks NLM ingestion). Thoughtlytics URL also failed.
**User additions**: Could not detect — this was a bootstrap run with empty registry. All 26 pre-existing sources catalogued as "pre-existing".
**Self-assessment**:
- Good: Successfully filled 4 previously empty categories (testing-qa, solopreneur, marketing-growth, productivity)
- Good: Removed 1 broken source confirmed by notebook AI as empty placeholder
- Good: Bootstrap of source registry with all 33 sources categorized
- Weakness: Still 0 sources in design-ux — could not find a good candidate that NLM could ingest
- Weakness: agent-patterns massively over-indexed (36% vs 20% target) but didn't remove any since they're pre-existing and potentially valuable
- Weakness: Some URL imports failed (Medium, Thoughtlytics) — need to find alternative sources next time
**Next run focus**:
- Priority 1: design-ux sources (completely missing) — search for AI-assisted UI/UX workflow content
- Priority 2: More solopreneur + marketing-growth sources to reach 10% targets
- Priority 3: Consider consolidating agent-patterns (12 sources, 6 from agentsys alone) — evaluate if some are redundant
- Priority 4: Track user additions vs this baseline registry
