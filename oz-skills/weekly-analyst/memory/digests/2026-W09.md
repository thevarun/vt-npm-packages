# Digest: 2026-W09

## Stats
- Sessions: 9 (37 incl. subagents) | Projects: 2
- Tool calls: 364 | Errors: 0
- Top tools: Read(107), Edit(87), Bash(64), Task(43)

## Projects
- **vt-saas-template** (7 sessions): deep-audit → fix-audit-findings pipeline, 14 refactoring themes across 4 phases, BMAD workflow with subagent orchestration
- **vt-spells** (2 sessions): weekly-analyst setup, claude-sessions-sync repo creation

## Key Patterns
- Dominant workflow: audit-fix pipeline spanning multiple sessions with sidecar YAML state
- Heavy /clear usage (5/9 sessions) — context pressure from step-file re-reads
- Zero errors — BMAD architecture produces reliable execution
- Interaction style: launch workflow → "C" (Continue) → subagents execute autonomously

## Top Findings
1. Orchestrator context overhead from re-reading workflow/step files on resume
2. Reactive /clear instead of proactive /compact
3. Step-file verbosity consuming orchestrator context budget
4. Enrichment subagent turn counts not tracked

## Suggestions
- 2026-W09-001 [HIGH] Resume checkpoint mechanism for fix-audit-findings
- 2026-W09-002 [MEDIUM] Proactive /compact at 70% capacity
- 2026-W09-003 [MEDIUM] .claudeignore for vt-saas-template
- 2026-W09-004 [LOW] Track enrichment subagent turn counts

## Innovations
1. Session handoff files — auto-generate resume brief from sidecar state
2. Enrichment caching — skip unchanged themes on re-run
3. Cross-workflow learning — share audit state across deep-audit and fix-audit-findings
